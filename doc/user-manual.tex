\section{Welcome}
Congratulations on being able to figure out how to open this User Manual.
You're now well on your way to experiencing the revolutionary new image editor
known as the Multi-User Infinite Canvas Thingy, also called MICT. This program
creates a canvas that can be edited by multiple people at the same time
allowing for more productive days even when you are away from the office.

\section{System Requirements}
To use MICT to its full potential, you will need a client install and a server
install. These can be on the same machine, but that would be pointless.

\subsection{Client Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item A computer running Windows XP or newer, Mac OS X 10.5 or newer, or a
recent version of Linux (tested on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and 10.04 LTS)
\item Java 1.6 or later. The program has been tested with the Oracle and Apple
JVMs. Other implementations of Java may not function properly
\item Apache Ant (tested with v. 1.8.1)
\item A broadband Internet connection
\item 15 MB of hard drive space
\item Some RAM, but so little that it's not worth discussing.
\item A graphics card. Any one manufactured in the last 15 years or so should
do

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Server System Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item A computer running a modern operating system. The server has only been
tested on Ubuntu 10.04 but should run on other versions of Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows.
\item The PostgreSQL database (tested with 8.2)
\item Apache Ant (tested with v. 1.8.1) or GNU Make (Linux/Mac OS X only)
\item A broadband Internet connection
\item A processor
\item (optional, but preferred) a URL that it can be reached at
\end{itemize}

\section{Installing MICT}
First of all, please ensure that all prerequisites are installed on your
computer. Java and Apache Ant should be on your System path. If you're using
Linux or Mac OS X, It Just Works\texttrademark. If you are on Windows, you'll
have to work a little bit harder

TODO: Explain how to put stuff on path for Windows or find workaround

Simply extract the given compressed folder wherever you want the program- no
installation required.

\section{Running MICT}
Double click on the included runclient script if you're running the client. If
you're on Mac OS X or Linux, click on the runclient.sh file. If you're on
Windows, use runclient.bat. For the server, follow the same instructions but
do runserver instead of run client.
